Generative adversarial networks consists of a model with two neural networks, G (generative model) and D (discriminative model), which are competing in a minimax two-player game.

The neural network G is modeled to capture the data distribution, and it's purpose is to generate new content. The network D is the discriminator, which purpose is to estimate the probability that a sample came from the training data rather then generated by G.
The training of the G network ultimately is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake (minimax strategy). The mutual training of the GAN creates a form of competition where D is getting better at the prediction (distinguishing between real and generated data), and G is learning to become less predictable.

GANs are difficult to train due to the fact that the training of G and D must be well synchronized. If D or G becomes too good compared to the other, a GAN won't converge (Helvetica scenario). GANs don't need to use Markov chains and no inference on the data is needed in the learning sessions.
