title: Top-1 error rate
---
The term *top-1 error rate* refers method of benchmarking
machine learning models in the ImageNet
Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition.

The model is considered to have classified a given image correctly
if the target label is the model's top prediction. This
is in contrast to the [top-5 error rate](/terms/top-5-error-rate/)
where the model only needs to identify the correct label in the
model's top 5 predictions.
