A convex combination is a linear combination, where all
the coefficients are greater than 0 and sum to 1.

The [Convex Combination Wikipedia article][1] gives the following example:

Given a finite number of points $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$ in a real vector
space, a convex combination of these points is a point of the form

$$
a_1 x_1 + a_2 x _2 + \ldots + a_n x_n
$$
is a convex combination if all real numbers $a_i \geq 0$ and
$a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n = 1$
