# $f(\cdot)$ Center-dot notation in functions
Some papers will use a center dot (or [interpunct][4]) to represent
that any value can be inserted as the value of a function.

For example, $\arg \max f(\cdot)$ means the same as $\mathop{\arg\max}\limits_x f(x)$

See [Mathematics StackExchange][5] for more information.

# $\nabla$ [Gradient]({% link terms/gradient.md %})
The $\nabla$ symbol when seen in front of a vector-valued function
like $\nabla f(x)$ refers to the function's gradient.

# $\odot$ [Hadamard Product]({% link terms/hadamard-product.md %})
This circle-dot symbol [can mean a few different things][1], depending on context.
Typically in machine learning literature, it refers to the Hadamard product
(component-wise multiplication for matrices).

# $\sigma$ Sigma
The $\sigma$ symbol is often used to represent the [standard deviation][7]
of a probability distribution.

When used as a function that takes in a value, e.g. $\sigma(x)$,
then it refers to the [logistic sigmoid function][3].

Wikipedia has [a more complete list of the symbol's uses][2]

# $\oplus$ XOR, exclusive-or, exclusive disjunction
The XOR operator is a logical operator that takes two terms. It returns
true when both inputs differ.

For example, $a \oplus b$ is only true when $a$ is true and $b$ is false,
or when $b$ is false and when $a$ is true.

Put another way, $a \oplus b$ will be false when both $a$ and $b$ are false,
or when both $a$ and $b$ are true. See [Exclusive or][6] on Wikipedia for more
information.

# $[x]_+$ , bracket operator, max operator

The bracket operator $[x]_+$ where an expression $x$ is surrounded by a plus sign and a subscript is equivalent to $\max(0,X)$. See [8] for more information.
