title: First-order information
needs_review: true

First-order information is a term used to mean information obtained
by computing the first derivative of a function. The first
derivative of a function reveals the slope of a tangent
line to the function. This gives a general idea of how the function
is changing at that point, but does not give information
about the *curvature* of the function--the second derivative
is required for that.

First-order information should not be confused with
[first-order logic][1].
