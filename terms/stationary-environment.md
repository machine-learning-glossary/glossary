title: Stationary environment
---
A stationary environment refers to data-generating distributions
that do not change over time.

A non-stationary environment, in contrast, refers to data-generating
distributions that do change over time.

It is a difficult problem to train machine learning algorithms
to generalize well in non-stationary environments. See
[Machine Learning in Non-Stationary Environments][1] for
more information.
