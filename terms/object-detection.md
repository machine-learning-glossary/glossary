In computer vision, *object detection* is the problem of detecting whether
a piece of data--such an image or LIDAR scan--contains an object
of interest to the model.

Applications of object detection may also involve
[object localization](/terms/object-localization/), which involves finding
the location of an object within an image (or other input data).
