The word *entailment* has many meanings. Please review Wikipedia's [disambiguation page for "entail"][1]
for definitions that do not refer to *textual entailment*.

Textual entailment refers to drawing a relation from an *entailing text*
to an *entailed hypothesis*.

The Wikipedia page for [textual entailment][2] gives the following examples:

> Textual entailment can be illustrated with examples of three different relations:
>
> An example of a positive TE (text entails hypothesis) is:
>
>  - **text**: If you help the needy, God will reward you.
>  - **hypothesis**: Giving money to a poor man has good consequences.
>
> An example of a negative TE (text contradicts hypothesis) is:
>
>  - **text**: If you help the needy, God will reward you.
>  - **hypothesis**: Giving money to a poor man has no consequences.
>
> An example of a non-TE (text does not entail nor contradict) is:
>
> - **text**: If you help the needy, God will reward you.
> - **hypothesis**: Giving money to a poor man will make you a better person.
