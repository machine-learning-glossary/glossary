*Inceptionism* refers to a visualization technique to understand what
a neural network learned. The network is fed an image,
asked what the network detected, and then that feature in the
image is *amplified*. The full technique is described in the
Google Research blog post titled [Inceptionism: Going Deeper into Neural Networks](https://research.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html).
