*Connectionist Temporal Classification* is a term coined in a paper by
Graves et al. titled [Connectionist Temporal Classification: Labelling Unsegmented Sequence Data with Recurrent Neural Networks][1].

It refers to the use of [recurrent neural networks][2]
(which is a form of [connectionism][3]) for the purpose of
labeling unsegmented data sequences (AKA [temporal classification][4]).
