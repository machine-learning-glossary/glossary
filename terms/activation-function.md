title: Activation function
---
In neural networks, an activation function defines
the output of a neuron.

The activation function takes the dot product of
the input to the neuron ($\mathbf x$) and the weights ($\mathbf w$).

Typically activation functions are nonlinear, as that allows the
network to approximate a wider variety of functions.
