SyntaxNet is a framework for natural language syntactic
parsers released by Google in 2016.

SyntaxNet tags words in a sentence with their syntactic part-of-speech
and creates a parse tree showing dependencies between words
in a sentence.

Parsey McParseface is a SyntaxNet model trained on the English
language. At its time of release, Parsey McParseface is the
world's most accurate model of its kind.
