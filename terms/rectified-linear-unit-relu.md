A Rectified Linear Unit is a common name for a neuron (the "unit")
with an activation function of $f(x) = \max(0,x)$.

Neural networks built with ReLU have the following advantages:

 - [gradient][1] computation is simpler because the activation
 function is computationally similar than comparable activation
 functions like $\tanh(x)$.
 - Neural networks with ReLU are less susceptible to
 the [vanishing gradient problem][2] but may suffer from
 the [dying ReLU problem][3].
