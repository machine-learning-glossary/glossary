*Paragraph Vectors* is the name of the model proposed by [Le and Mikolov][1] to
generate unsupervised representations of sentences, paragraphs, or entire documents
without losing local word order.

This is in contrast to [bag-of-words](/terms/bag-of-words/) representations, which
can offer useful representations of documents but lose all word order information.
