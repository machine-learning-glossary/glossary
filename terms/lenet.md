LeNet was an early convolutional neural network proposed
by Lecun et al in the paper
[Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf).

LeNet was designed for handwriting recognition. Many modern
convolutional neural network architectures are inspired by LeNet.
