Reinforcement learning is about learning from feedback (reinforcement) while learning 'on the job', i.e. learning by trying, rather than from labeled answer data.
This is how robots may learn, but is also used for playing games, a tight feedback loop through e.g. score may help give the algorithm an idea of what works well.
