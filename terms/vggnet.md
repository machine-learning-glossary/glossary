VGGNet is a deep convolutional neural network 
for image recognition, trained by
the Visual Geometry Group (VGG) at the University of Oxford.

VGGNet helped the VGG team secure the [first place
in Localization and second place in Classification][1]
in the 2014 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition.
