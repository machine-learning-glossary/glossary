DCGAN refers to a model described by [Radford, Metz, and Chintala][1]
that uses deep convolutional neural networks in a generative adversarial network model.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are structured as a competition between
two models:

1. a generative model that tries to create fake examples of training data interspersed with real training data.
2. a discriminative model that tries to classify real examples from fake ones.

DCGAN uses deep convolutional neural networks for both models. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
are well-known for their performance on image data. DCGAN uses the strong performance of (CNNs)
to learn [unsupervised representations][2] of the input data.
