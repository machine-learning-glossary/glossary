LDADE is a tool proposed by Agrawal et al. in a paper
titled [What is Wrong with Topic Modeling? (and How to Fix it Using Search-based Software Engineering)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08176).

It tunes [LDA](/terms/latent-dirichlet-allocation-lda) parameters
using
[Differential Evolution](/terms/differential-evolution/) to increase
the [clustering stability](/terms/clustering-stability/) of standard LDA.
