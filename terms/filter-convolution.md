A *filter* (also known as a *kernel*) is a small matrix
used in convolution operations.

Convolution filters are commonly used in image processing
to modify images or extract features.

The dimensions of a convolution filter are typically small,
odd, and square. For example, convolution filters are typically
$3 \times 3$ or $5 \times 5$ matrices. Odd dimensions are
preferred to even dimensions.
