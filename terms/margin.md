In machine learning, a *margin* often refers to the
distance between the two hyperplanes that separate linearly-separable classes of data points.

![In this [image from Wikipedia][1], the dotted lines represent the two hyperplanes dividing the white and black data points. The region between the lines is the margin.](/images/margin.png)

The term is most commonly used when discussing
[support vector machines][2], but often appears in
other literature discussing boundaries between points in a vector space.
