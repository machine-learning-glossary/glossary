Semi-supervised learning mixes labeled and labeled data
to produce better models.

In machine learning, finding or creating correctly-labeled data
(e.g. images with annotations and descriptions, audio
with text transcriptions) can be difficult or expensive.

Semi-supervised learning techniques take advantage
of a small amount of labeled data and a large amount
of unlabeled data to produce a better model than
a purely [supervised learning](/terms/supervised-learning/)
or a purely [unsupervised learning](/terms/unsupervised-learning/)
technique.
