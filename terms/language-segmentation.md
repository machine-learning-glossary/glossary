> This is important for all natural language processing tasks.

> One important point that has to be borne in mind is the difference between language
> identification and language segmentation. Language identification is concerned with recognizing
> the language at hand. It is possible to use language identification for language segmentation.
> Indeed, by identifying the languages in a text, the segmentation is implicitly obtained.
> Language segmentation on the other hand is only concerned with identifying language
> boundaries. No claims about the languages involved are made.
