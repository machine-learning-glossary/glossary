In statistical plotting, a facet is a type of plot. Data
is split into subsets and the subsets are plotted
in a row or grid of subplots.

The term is common among users of [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/),
a plotting package for the
[R statistical computing language](https://www.r-project.org/about.html).
