Catastrophic forgetting (or catastrophic interference) is a problem
in machine learning where a model forgets an existing learned pattern
when learning a new one.

The model uses the same parameters to recognize both patterns,
and learning the second pattern overwrites the parameters'
configuration from having learned the first pattern.
