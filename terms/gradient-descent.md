title: Gradient descent
---
Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm designed
to find the minimum of a function. Many machine learning
algorithms use gradient descent or a variant.

Common variants include:
 - [Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)](/terms/stochastic-gradient-descent-sgd/)
 - [Minibatch Gradient Descent](/terms/minibatch-gradient-descent/)
