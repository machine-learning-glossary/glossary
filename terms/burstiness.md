Wikipedia defines burstiness as follows:

> In statistics, burstiness is the intermittent increases and decreases in activity or frequency of an event. One of measures of burstiness is the Fano factorâ€”a ratio between the variance and mean of counts.

## Word Burstiness
In natural language processing, burstiness has a slightly more specific definition,
[defined by Slava Katz in the mid 1990s][2].

The authors of [Accounting for Burstiness in Topic Models][1] give the following succinct definition
of burstiness:

> Church and Gale (1995) note that real texts systematically exhibit this phenomenon: a word is more likely to occur again in a document if it has already appeared in the document. Importantly, the burstiness of a word and its semantic content are positively correlated; words that are more informative are also more bursty.

Additionally, burstiness also tells us that later appearances of a word are [less significant][3]
than the first appearance.
> If a term is used once in a document, then it is likely to be used again. This phenomenon is called burstiness, and it implies that the second and later appearances of a word are less significant than the first appearance.
