Wikipedia describes variance as follows:

> In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean, and it informally measures how far a set of (random) numbers are spread out from their mean. 

Variance the square of standard deviation, or rather, [standard deviation][1] is the square root of variance.
Thus, sometimes variance is written as $\sigma^2$ where $\sigma$ stands for the standard deviation.
