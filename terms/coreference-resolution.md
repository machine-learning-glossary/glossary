The Stanford NLP group [defines coreference resolution][1] as:

> Coreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text. It is an important step for a lot of higher level NLP tasks that involve natural language understanding such as document summarization, question answering, and information extraction.

Coreference resolution should not be confused with
[Named Entity Recognition](/terms/named-entity-recognition-ner/), which is focused on labeling
sequences of text that refer to entities--but not focused
on linking those entities together.
