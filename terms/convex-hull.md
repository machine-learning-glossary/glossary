The convex hull of a set $X$ in an affine space over the reals is the smallest
[convex set][1] that contains $X$. When the points are two dimensional,
the convex hull can be thought of as the rubber band around the points of $X$.

As per Wikipedia, a [convex set][1] is the smallest affine space
closed under convex combination.

A [convex combination][2] is a linear combination where
all the coefficients are greater than 0 and all sum to 1.
